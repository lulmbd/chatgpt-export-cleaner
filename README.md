# 🧹 ChatGPT Export Cleaner

A script to parse and clean OpenAI ChatGPT data exports, and convert them into clean Markdown conversations, prompt-completion JSONL files for fine-tuning, and CSV.

---

## ✨ Overview

When you export your ChatGPT data from OpenAI, the archive includes your entire usage history — but in a raw, cluttered JSON format.  
This tool extracts your conversations, cleans metadata, and converts them into structured, human-readable files.

Whether you're an AI researcher, a data enthusiast, or simply a power user, this script helps you **back up**, **analyze**, or even **fine-tune models** using your personal ChatGPT history.

---

## 📁 Output Files

The script generates:

- `markdown_by_conversation/` → one clean `.md` file per conversation
- `all_conversations.json` → structured JSON export of all chats
- `pairs.jsonl` → optional format for LLM fine-tuning (prompt → completion)

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optionally, you can use a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Export your ChatGPT data** from [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com):  
   → _Settings > Data Controls > Export Data_

2. **Unzip** the archive and place the `conversations.json` file inside the project folder.

3. **Run the script** (adapt to the file name if needed):

```bash
python chatgpt_export_cleaner.py --in conversations.json --out out_export
```
